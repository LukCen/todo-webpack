A to-do app made using JS, with help of WebPack and a few modules. Created as a practice project from The Odin Project. 

ROADMAP :

1) User can dynamically create to-do items, consisting of a title, description, due date and a completion status []
2) User can dynamically delete each individual to-do item without impacting others []
3) User can mark individual to-do items as complete, with appropriate visual (and maybe sound?) effect accompanying. []
3b) Items can also be unmarked, returning them to their non-completed state []
4) Implement a 'delete all completed' button. []
5) Implement a simple login/storage system using local storage []
